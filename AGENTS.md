# Changelog management
Always add created commits to the CHANGELOG.md by commit ID reference with a one-two liner summary and a Github reference to the user.
The section called ### Commits contains these changes by release.
If the commit changes only the changelog, you don't need to add it to the CHANGELOG.md.

# Git handling: 
- Always sign commits with -s flag
